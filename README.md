# 1-out-of-2-Oblivious-Transfer-System
This project implements a 1-out-of-2 Oblivious Transfer (OT) protocol based on the Rabin cryptosystem, a fundamental primitive in secure multi-party computation. OT allows a receiver to obtain one of two messages from a sender without revealing which one was chosen, and ensures the sender learns nothing about the choice.
